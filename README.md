# Node.js Playbook

This is a opinionated "get started" guide to developing with Node.js.

### Problem / Context
You waste time by:

* discovering/researching basic aspects of Node.js development, and
* choosing from amongst several tool options that do the same job

### Recommended solution
Follow this playbook. It recommends basic choices that let you focus on writing code instead of setting things up.

### Who this is for

* Beginners who just want to get a project started without too much hassle
* Veterans who want a quick reference guide to unfamiliar parts of the Node.js ecosystem

### What this is not

* This does not teach you JavaScript
* This is **not the only way** to develop with Node.js. Use this playbook to get started, then use other choices when applicable
* This is **not the best way** to develop with Node.js. It is *a way* that is good enough to get started without a lot of learning overhead
* This does not replace the need to read documentation
* Not all advice is specific to Node.js

### How solutions were chosen

Each solution was chosen after balancing:

* is it mature? (look for a version 1)
* is it actively maintained?
* does it have good documentation?
* is it popular? (so that you can find lots of tutorials and a support community)
* is it free and open source? (as much as possible, except for hosting and domains)
* is it easy to learn?
* is it practical to use daily?
* does it work well with the rest of the playbook?

# The Golden Rule: avoid coding wherever possible
Be **optimally lazy**. There are only two principles:

1. The fastest way to finish a task is to do nothing
  * Ask yourself if you can live without it
  * Less code means less bugs
  * See also:
    * [You aren't gonna need it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) (YAGNI)
    * [Customer development](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/what-is-customer-development.html)
    * [Minimum viable product](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) (MVP)
1. The second fastest way to finish a task is to get someone else to do it
  * For example, this playbook is an example of using someone else's work to get ahead
  * Use [Node.js core API](https://nodejs.org/api/) if you can get away with it
  * Use pre-built pieces of code, such as [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/)
    * Make sure your dependencies are of high quality

# General problems
This section covers general problems regardless of your development goals.

## Node.js version
### Problem / Context
Many versions are listed on the Node.js website. Choosing a Node.js version wastes time.
### Recommended solution
Choose [Node.js v6](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/). It will enter long term support (LTS) on October 1, 2016, after which it will stay in LTS for 18 months. This gives you peace of mind against major new features popping up in Node.js while you build your app.

## Development environment
### Problem / Context
Choosing a development environment (e.g. editors, git GUIs, terminals, FTP clients) wastes time. No tool is 10 times better than another. You need a set of tools that get you started and let you grow according to you needs.
### Recommended solution
Download and install these tools:
* Editor: [Atom](https://atom.io/)
  * Atom packages/plug-ins:
    * atom-beautify (go into `Settings > Packages` and enable `Beautify On Save` for CSS, HTML, JavaScript, JSON, and Markdown)
    * atom-html-preview (press `Ctrl+P` in the editor to open the preview)
    * fold-lines
    * terminal-plus
    * markdown-preview (press `Ctrl+Shift+M` in the editor to open the preview)
* Version control: [git](https://git-scm.com/)
* Repository (repo) hosting: [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * for private repos: either pay GitHub or use [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) instead
* Git GUI: [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (why: you can upload/push much faster and clone repos from GitHub *and* BitBucket)
* API testing: [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps)
* Socket testing: [Socket.io tester](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/socketio-tester/cgmimdpepcncnjgclhnhghdooepibakm?hl=en)

## Workflow
### Problem / Context
Thinking about how to set up a new project wastes time.
### Recommended solution
1. Create a new repo on either GitHub or BitBucket
  * Choose Node under the gitignore settings when creating a repo
  * Choose to create a README.md
1. Clone it to your computer with either a terminal command or with SourceTree
1. Set up your [file and folder structure](#file-and-folder-structure)
1. Open a terminal window in your repo folder (or use the Terminal button when you open the repo in SourceTree)
1. Run `npm init` in your terminal to create a `package.json` file
  * Set your initial version to 0.1.0 (see also [version numbering](#version-numbering))
  * If this is an open source project then choose an MIT license by typing `MIT` when prompted for a license name
1. Run `atom ./` in your terminal to launch Atom in your project folder

## File and folder structure
### Problem / Context
Thinking about how to set up your project file and folder structure wastes time.
### Recommended solution
1. Create three subfolders:
  1. `source`: place all your source code here
  1. `test`: place all testing code here
  1. `build` (optional): use this as a destination folder if/when you implement a build system (something that converts your source code to another form)
1. Create a file in the `source` sub-folder called `index.js`

## Coding style
### Problem / Context
Fretting over coding style wastes time, and a sloppy coding style reflects poorly on you. You need a coding style that looks decent and is easy to follow.
### Recommended solution
Follow [Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)

## Native modules and Windows
### Problem / Context
Some npm packages do not install on Windows because they contain non-JavaScript code. You will see errors related to `node-gyp` when you try to install them.
### Recommended solution
Find another npm package that does the job in pure JavaScript. For example, [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs) is a drop-in replacement for the popular [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) module.

How to find alternatives:
* if the repo is hosted on GitHub or a similar platform, search the Issues for anyone mentioning Windows or node-gyp. It is likely someone in the thread has linked to a pure JavaScript replacement
* search online

Make sure that your chosen alternative is a suitable replacement. Look for:
* recently active contributors
* good documentation
* number of downloads

This is the simplest solution as it eliminates the problem rather than trying to accommodate it. The speed advantage from the native module will not be missed until later in your development cycle.
### Alternative solution
Do this **if and only if** you cannot find a suitable alternative npm package.

Follow the Windows installation instructions at the [node-gyp README](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#Installation).

I never got this to work despite many tries.

# Developing for the web
This section covers problems commonly encountered with developing, deploying, and distributing web applications.

## Technology stack
### Problem / Context
Choosing a technology stack (e.g. server framework, database, front-end framework, hosting platform) wastes time. Every stack is different and affects your project, however this is mostly a matter of style. Every stack will do the job.
### Recommended solution
* Back-end:
  * Hosting: [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
  * Server framework: [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
  * Database: PostgresSQL (host it on Heroku)
  * Object-relational mapping: [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
* Front-end
  * Domain: [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration.aspx?aff=103766) (affiliate link) [[non-affiliate link](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration.aspx)]
  * Hosting: [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared.aspx?aff=103766) (affiliate link) [[non-affiliate link](https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared.aspx)] (looking for free CDN suggestions that support custom domains)
  * JavaScript: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react), create your app using [`create-react-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)
  * Styling: [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

# Developing a package
This section covers problems commonly encountered with developing and publishing reusable packages.

## Version numbering
### Problem / Context
Deciding on a version number scheme wastes time. Using a non-standard scheme confuses anyone using your package.
### Recommended solution
Use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) (a.k.a. semver). Here are the most important bits to get started:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
>
> How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?
>
> The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.
>
> How do I know when to release 1.0.0?
>
> If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backwards compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.

# Developing mobile applications
This section covers problems commonly encountered with:
* developing and distributing native mobile applications in JavaScript
* serving mobile users for web applications

I am seeking contributors for this section.

## Building iOS / Android Apps
### Problem / Context
Mobile development often requires learning new technologies and can increase complexity via context switching.
### Recommended Solution
Use React Native. Since you've already learned and used React for your JavaScript web app you already know React and don't have to learn anything new to build your mobile app. You can even completely reuse components from your web app in your mobile app as Facebook has reimplemented flexbox and common CSS properties on mobile. Simply run the [react-native-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-cli) to generate your app and you'll be all set. You can still use Atom as your IDE and the React Native documentation is well-written and covers most mobile topics from making API calls to core animation libraries. 

# Developing desktop applications
This section covers problems commonly encountered with developing and distributing desktop applications.

I am seeking contributors for this section.

## Cross platform framework
### Problem / Context
Deciding which cross platform framework to use is a waste of time.
### Recommended solution
Use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). It is now considered stable as version 1 was released on May 11, 2016. It is backed by the makers of GitHub and Atom, and has a strong community. Electron apps build and run on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
